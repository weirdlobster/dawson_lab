# dawson_lab
Some scripts useful to work done in the Dawson lab.

Metagenomics was the focus in this lab, specifically on unicellular eukaryotes in mixed culture.

Below is a quick outline of what you'll find:

1. Assembly
metaSPAdes was my assembler of choice, but Megahit would be my choice for larger or more complex 
datasets that would take beyond 3 weeks to complete.

2. Anvi'o
We used anvi'o for processing the assembled metagenome into bins, as well as other tasks that it was 
well-suited for (pangenomes).
